(Don’t use it for bad things, or I will be sad) Preparation Have any type of linux server that is not blocked. (I’m going to be using a AWS Server or leave a raspberry pi at your house) Viscosity(30 day trial, there is a loop hole though on mac, hit: minimize the tab) Let’s startJust some advices: I personally recommend you to ssh to your server, and if your SSH port(22) is blocked, I recommend you to use the google shell as a “proxy”. If you are using AWS, its ssh -i [pemfile] [user]@[ipv4 address] Step 1:Get into root by typing sudo suthen:apt-get updateapt-get upgradeDepends on the linux OS you are using, the command may vary Step 2:Read this before the following: Use TCP instead of UDP Set the port number for Openvpn/Pivpn as 1194 because port 443 is used for the obfs4, because thats the only port that most schools do not block. Attention! if you haven’t read the thing on the top, go and read it!Install Openvpn(not needed if using raspberry pi):apt-get install openvpnInstall Pivpn(I recommend it, I saves you a lot of time):curl -L https://install.pivpn.io | bash Step 3:Install obfs4:apt-get install obfs4proxy Obfs4 directory:mkdir -p /var/lib/tor/pt_state/obfs4 Add config file:vim /var/lib/tor/pt_state/obfs4/obfs4.config Add this line into config: 1TOR_PT_MANAGED_TRANSPORT_VER=1TOR_PT_STATE_LOCATION=/var/lib/tor/pt_state/obfs4TOR_PT_SERVER_TRANSPORTS=obfs4TOR_PT_SERVER_BINDADDR=obfs4-0.0.0.0:443TOR_PT_ORPORT=127.0.0.1:1194 Create SystemD:vim /etc/systemd/system/obfs4proxy.service Paste this: 1[Unit]Description=Obfsproxy Server[Service]EnvironmentFile=/var/lib/tor/pt_state/obfs4/obfs4.configExecStart=/usr/bin/obfs4proxy -enableLogging true -logLevelStr INFO[Install]WantedBy=multi-user.target Enable obfs4proxy:sudo systemctl start obfs4proxysudo systemctl enable obfs4proxy Get obfs4 key:cat /var/lib/tor/pt_state/obfs4/obfs4_bridgeline.txt it should say cert=JKLFDSFKHSDIFHSIUSF(I made this up), but you will find it in ur obfs4_bridgeline.xt file and it is your obfs4 key. Step 4:create user:pivpn -aand follow the steps by using sftp, get the ovpn file from your ovpns folder.Note: same as how you connect to your machine, you just replace ssh to sftpAWS: sftp -i [pemfile] [user]@[ipv4 address] Step 5: Import the ovpn file into Viscosity Change the port number to 443 In Transport-obfuscation choose obfs4 Insert your key from step 3 Step 6:Connect!

It has a really interesting mechanics that is obvious but at least I haven’t really thought about how it work. 1.1.1 have provided a lot of physics behind it. $p = mv$ is the momentum formula, and the momentum thrust is the major way to push the spacecraft in outer space when there is no water to row on. Initial StageAssume you have a rocket with mass $m$ that is traveling at a velocity(Don’t forget its a vector) of $v$ has the momentum of $p = mv$. Propelling StageYou start using your fuel. You can treat your rocket as two small systems. #Divide And Conquer PropellentsThe propellent is going away at a rate of $dm_p$, with an exhaust velocity of $v_{ex}$.Therefore we can get $p_p = dm_p \\times (v + v_{ex})$. ($v$ is vector, $v_{ex}$ is “negative”). RocketRocket’s total mass will be decreasing at at rate of $dm$(-). Velocity will be increasing at a rate of $dv(+)$. So the formula is $p_r = (m + dm)(v+dv)$. AddBy adding the formula, you will get the equation m \\star dv = dm \\star $v_{ex}$. Because $F = ma$. $F_{ex} = dm \\times v_{ex}$. Since the F will be “negative”, we will change it back to positive by inserting “-“ sign in front.
